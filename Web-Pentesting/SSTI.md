#### What is a Template:
A **template** is a file used to generate **dynamic content** in a web application. It combines **static HTML** with **placeholders** that get replaced by **real data** from the server.

Websites use **templates** to dynamically insert **user-specific or database-driven data** into HTML pages before sending them to your browser.

#### How to Check if a website uses Template or not:

## **Look for Dynamic Content**

If a page is:
- Personalized (e.g., shows your name, email, user data)
- Changes based on URL or form input
- Shows errors that include parts of your input
    
➡️ It likely uses **templates**.

To determine if a website uses a template, you can examine the site's source code or inspect , look for patterns or comments related to a template provider, or use online tools designed to identify website templates. Checking the footer for "theme by" or "template by" text, or using reverse image search on site images, can also be helpful. Look for something that we can gib data and it will display
```
${{<%[%'"}}%\
```
- Input these to get an error and u need to identify the template engine used based on error it throws out.

Try inserting common template payloads into:

- URL parameters
- Form fields
- Cookies
- HTTP headers
