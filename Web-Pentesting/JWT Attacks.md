A JWT is a compact, self-contained way to transmit information between two parties as a JSON object securely. It’s designed to ensure data integrity and authenticity without the need for server-side session management. It is deemed credible because the token's data is digitally signed using a shared secret (**HMAC**) or public/private key pair (**RSA** or **ECDSA**).
It is commonly used for:
- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **Session management**

## Structure of a JWT

A JWT has **three parts**, separated by dots (`.`):
```
<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
```

#### Header
- The header _typically_ consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. this JSON is **Base64Url** encoded to form the first part of the JWT

#### Payload
- The payload contains the actual data of the user which is base64 encoded

#### Signature
- To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign .The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.


### 1. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**

**Definition**:  
A JWT is a compact, URL-safe format for representing JSON-based claims that can be transmitted between two parties.  
It is a data structure, not inherently signed or encrypted.

### 2. **JWS (JSON Web Signature)**

**Definition**:  
A JWS is a **signed JWT** that ensures **data integrity and authenticity**.  
The payload is **readable**, but **cannot be tampered with** without breaking the signature.

**Format**:

```
<base64url(header)>.<base64url(payload)>.<base64url(signature)>
```

---

### 3. **JWE (JSON Web Encryption)**

**Definition**:  
A JWE is an **encrypted JWT** that ensures **data confidentiality**.  
Only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the payload.

**Format**:

```
<base64url(encrypted header)>.<base64url(encrypted key)>.<base64url(IV)>.<base64url(ciphertext)>.<base64url(auth tag)>
```


<p align="justify">By design, servers don't usually store any information about the JWTs that they issue. Instead, each token is an entirely self-contained entity. This has several advantages, but also introduces a fundamental problem - the server doesn't actually know anything about the original contents of the token, or even what the original signature was. Therefore, if the server doesn't verify the signature properly, there's nothing to stop an attacker from making arbitrary changes to the rest of the token.</p>
