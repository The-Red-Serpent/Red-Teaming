### 1.Tech Stack Identification
- Involves identifying tech stack of the web application and as well as Server version
```
whatweb -v example.com
```
### 2.Security Headers
Involves checking the security headers to look for low hanging fruits
```
nuclei -u https://example.com -t http/misconfiguration/security-headers/
```
### 3.Web Crawling
```
katana -u https://example.com -jc -d 7 -kf all -silent
```

```
octocrawl https://example.org
```
### 4.SSL Scanning
Involves testing for SSL vulns
```
sslscan example.com
```
### 5.Vulnerability Analysis
- Throw the web app into Burp Active scan and scan the web app with nuclei and Nikto
```
nuclei -u https://example.com -t ~/nuclei-templates/
```

```
nikto -h https://example.com -ssl -Tuning x -o nikto.txt
```
### 6.Directory Brute forcing
Involves finding all the hidden directories and Sensitive endpoints
```
dirsearch -u https//target.com-e conf, config, bak, backup, smp, old, env, git, db, sql, asp, aspx, py, rb, tar.gz,smp,tar,bz2, txt, wadl, zip, log, xml, js, json, php, cgi, htm, html, shtm, shtml, js, txt, zip, old, conf, log, pl, asp, aspx, jsp, sql, db, sqlite, mdb, tar, gz, 7z, rar, json, xml, yml, yaml, ini, java, py, rb, php3, php4, php5 --random-agent --recursive -R 3 -t 20 --exclude-status=404 -x 301,403,404,500,400,502,503,302,429  --follow-redirects --delay=0.1 -w wordlist.txt -t 50
```
### 7. JS files
involves Extracting js files from the domain and extracting endpoints and Secrets from it

- Extracting JS files
```
katana -u https://example.com -jc -d 5 -silent | grep -iE "\.js(\?|$)" | sort -u
```

- Scanning for Endpoints
```
python3 LinkFinder.py -i js_files.txt -o cli
```

- Scanning for Secrets
```
python js_snitch.py --host example.com
```
### 8.Google Dorking
- Involves making a lot of possible dorks to looks for any Sensitive files
```
python3 dorks_hunter.py -d domain.com -o output.txt
```
### 9.Firewall and WAF/CDN Detection
involves Checking  for Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).  
```
wafw00f https://example.com -a

python3 whatwaf.py -u https://example.com

```
### 10.Way Back URLs
```
gau example.com | sort -u > gau.txt
waybackurls example.com | sort -u > wayback.txt
```
### 11.Parameter Discovery
Involves Finding Additional Parameters in the URL's
```
paramspider -d example.com

arjun -i urls.txt -o params.txt
```
