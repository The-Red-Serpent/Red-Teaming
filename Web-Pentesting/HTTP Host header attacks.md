## What is the HTTP `Host` Header?

> The `Host` header is an HTTP request header that **specifies the domain name** of the server the client wants to connect to.


An **HTTP Host Header attack** is a type of **injection attack** that exploits a web server's **trust in the `Host:` header** of an HTTP request.

> It occurs when the application dynamically constructs URLs, performs redirects, or routes traffic based on the `Host` header **without properly validating its value**. Since the `Host` header is client-controlled, this allows an attacker to manipulate server-side behavior or launch further attacks.


### How To Test
 You need to identify whether you are able to modify the Host header and still reach the target application with your request. If so, you can use this header to probe the application and observe what effect this has on the response.

##### Supply an arbitrary Host header:
- replace the `Host:` header with a malicious or fake domain unrecognized domain name via the Host header.
- if u are hit with "Invalid Host header" then move on with other techniques
-  If your target website happens to be the default, you're in luck.

##### Check for flawed validation:
- Instead of receiving an "`Invalid Host header`" response, you might find that your request is blocked as a result of some kind of security measure.
-  some parsing algorithms will omit the port from the Host header, meaning that only the domain name is validated. If you are also able to supply a non-numeric port, you can leave the domain name untouched to ensure that you reach the target application, while potentially injecting a payload via the port.
