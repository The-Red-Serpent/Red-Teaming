### What is SMB Null Session:
<p align="justify">An **SMB Null Session** is an unauthenticated connection to a **Server Message Block (SMB)** service on a Windows system or device. It occurs when an attacker or user connects to the SMB service without providing a valid username or password, essentially creating a **null session**. This connection allows the attacker to interact with certain network resources or services that are otherwise protected by authentication.</p>

If a machine or a domain joined machine has smb null authentication enables we can enumerate
- Password policy
- users
- computer
- groups

### Conditions
- Smb service must be running on 
- nmap command to check smb version
```
nmap --script smb2-security-mode,smb2-capabilities -p445 <IP>
```

### Tools
- rpcclient
- enum4linux
- enum4linux-ng
- smbclient
- smbmap
- crackmapexec



### LDAP Anonymous Bind
<p align="justify">**Anonymous Bind** in LDAP allows a client to access the LDAP server **without authentication** (no username or password). Essentially, when using **anonymous bind**, the LDAP client does not need to provide any credentials to query the directory.This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests.</p>
- It's a misconfiguration if this is allowed
We can gather
- users
- computer
- groups
- domain password policy

### Conditions
- A machine that run LDAP service on port 389/636
- The **LDAP server** must be configured to **allow anonymous binds**

### Tools:
- windapsearch
- ldapsearch
- ad-ldapdomaindump
- crackmapexec
- impacket-ldap


- Kerbrute can be used for username enumeration and validating its authenticity
