### Basics
#### Band Width
**Bandwidth** is the **maximum amount of data** that can be transmitted over a network in a given period.

**Higher bandwidth = More data can flow at once = Faster Wi-Fi speeds!**


#### Frequency
**Frequency** refers to **how often a signal wave repeats** in one second. It is measured in **Hertz (Hz)**.
- **Low frequency (e.g., 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi)** = **Slower, but travels farther** (like big, slow waves).
    
- **High frequency (e.g., 5 GHz or 6 GHz Wi-Fi)** = **Faster, but shorter range** (like fast, small waves).

|**Frequency Band**|**Speed**|**Range**|**Interference**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2.4 GHz**|Slower|Longer range|More interference (used by Bluetooth, microwaves)|
|**5 GHz**|Faster|Shorter range|Less interference|
|**6 GHz**|Fastest|Shortest range|Least interference (Wi-Fi 6E only)|

#### Band
**A band in networking refers to a specific range of frequencies** used for wireless communication, such as Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

Think of it like **radio stations**:

- Each station (band) broadcasts at a different frequency.
    
- Devices must tune into the correct band to communicate.
### **Types of Bands in Wi-Fi**

Wi-Fi networks operate on different **bands** to balance **speed, range, and interference**:

| **Band**    | **Frequency** | **Speed** | **Range** | **Interference**             |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| **2.4 GHz** | 2.4 GHz       | Slower    | Long      | High (microwaves, Bluetooth) |
| **5 GHz**   | 5 GHz         | Faster    | Shorter   | Low                          |
| **6 GHz**   | 6 GHz         | Fastest   | Shortest  | Lowest (Wi-Fi 6E only)       |

#### Channel
A frequency band is divided into multiple channels to allow multiple devices to communicate without interference.

**A channel is a smaller frequency range within a Wi-Fi band** that helps divide network traffic, reducing interference and improving performance.

### **Wi-Fi Channels in Different Bands**

| **Wi-Fi Band**       | **Available Channels**                    | **Best Channels**      | **Interference Level** |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **2.4 GHz**          | 11 (only 3 non-overlapping: **1, 6, 11**) | **1, 6, 11**           | High (crowded)         |
| **5 GHz**            | 25+ channels (non-overlapping)            | Most channels are good | Low                    |
| **6 GHz** (Wi-Fi 6E) | 60+ channels (all non-overlapping)        | Best for high speed    | Lowest                 |

A Frequency Band is Divided into Channels, and Each Channel Has a Bandwidth

### WI-FI
<p align="justify">   Wi-Fi is based on the **IEEE 802.11 standard**, which defines **how wireless devices communicate over a network**. Over time, different versions (b/g/n/ac/ax) have been developed to improve speed, range, and efficiency.</p>

### 802.11 Wi-Fi Standards

|**Standard**|**Definition**|**Year**|**Max Speed**|**Frequency Band**|**Channel Width**|**Key Features**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**802.11b**|First widely used Wi-Fi standard.|1999|**11 Mbps**|**2.4 GHz**|**20 MHz**|Long range, slow speed, interference issues.|
|**802.11g**|Improved speed over 802.11b.|2003|**54 Mbps**|**2.4 GHz**|**20 MHz**|Faster than 802.11b, but still 2.4 GHz.|
|**802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**|Introduced **dual-band Wi-Fi** (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz).|2009|**600 Mbps**|**2.4 & 5 GHz**|**20/40 MHz**|**MIMO** (Multiple antennas for better performance).|
|**802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**|Faster speeds with **5 GHz only**.|2014|**6.9 Gbps**|**5 GHz**|**20/40/80/160 MHz**|Introduced **MU-MIMO & Beamforming** for better signal strength.|
|**802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 & 6E)**|Most advanced Wi-Fi, supports **6 GHz** band.|2019|**9.6 Gbps**|**2.4, 5 & 6 GHz**|**20/40/80/160 MHz**|More efficient, supports **OFDMA, MU-MIMO, BSS Coloring** for better performance in crowded networks.|


### Encryption Mechanism

#### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
WEP (**Wired Equivalent Privacy**) is an **outdated Wi-Fi security protocol** introduced in **1997** as part of the **802.11 standard**. It was designed to provide wireless networks with **security equivalent to wired networks** but was later found to be **highly insecure** due to weak encryption.

####  WEP Encryption Process

1. **Key Generation:**
    
    - The user sets a **WEP key** (e.g., a password).
        
    - The key is either **40-bit (5 characters)** or **104-bit (13 characters)** long.
        
    - A **24-bit IV** is added to the key to form a **64-bit or 128-bit total key**.
        
2. **Data Encryption:**
    
    - WEP **combines the IV with the WEP key** to generate a **per-packet encryption key**.
        
    - The data is **encrypted using the RC4 algorithm** before being transmitted.
        
3. **Data Transmission:**
    
    - The **encrypted data** along with the **IV** is sent over the wireless network.
        
4. **Decryption:**
    
    - The receiving device extracts the **IV**, combines it with the WEP key, and **decrypts the data**.


### **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

WPA (**Wi-Fi Protected Access**) is a wireless security protocol introduced in **2003** to replace the outdated **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**. It provides **stronger encryption and authentication** to secure Wi-Fi networks.

WPA was an **interim security upgrade** before the introduction of **WPA2** and **WPA3**.

#### How WPA Works

- WPA **encrypts wireless network traffic** using the **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)** encryption method.
    
- Unlike WEP, **WPA dynamically changes encryption keys** for each packet to prevent attackers from cracking them.
    
- WPA supports **two authentication modes**:
    
    1. **WPA-Personal (WPA-PSK)** → Uses a pre-shared key (password).
        
    2. **WPA-Enterprise** → Uses a RADIUS server for authentication.
        

#### WPA Encryption Process

1. **Key Generation:**
    
    - A **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)** (password) is used in **WPA-Personal**.
        
    - In **WPA-Enterprise**, users authenticate via a **RADIUS server**.
        
2. **Encryption with TKIP:**
    
    - WPA uses **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**, which:
        
        - Changes encryption keys **for every data packet**.
            
        - Uses a **48-bit IV (Initialization Vector)** (better than WEP’s 24-bit IV).
            
3. **Data Transmission:**
    
    - Encrypted packets are **transmitted securely** over the Wi-Fi network.
        
4. **Decryption:**
    
    - The receiving device **uses the same key** to decrypt the data.

### WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) 

WPA2 (**Wi-Fi Protected Access 2**) is a **wireless security protocol** that replaced **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)** to provide **stronger encryption and security** for Wi-Fi networks. It was introduced in **2004** and is based on the **IEEE 802.11i standard**.
#### Why Was WPA2 Introduced?

WPA (which used TKIP) was a **temporary fix** for the weak **WEP encryption** but still had **security issues**.

- **WPA2 introduced AES (Advanced Encryption Standard),** which is far more secure than TKIP.
    

**Key Improvements Over WPA:**  
✅ Uses **AES encryption** instead of the weak **RC4 (used in TKIP).**  
✅ Provides **stronger data protection** and **better integrity checks.**  
✅ **Mandatory implementation of CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).**

---

#### How WPA2 Works

### **🔹 WPA2 Key Components**

1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Encryption**
    
    - Uses **128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys** for encrypting data.
        
    - Much stronger than WEP and TKIP.
        
2. **CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)**
    
    - Provides **data confidentiality and integrity**.
        
    - Prevents **replay attacks and tampering**.
        
3. **Two WPA2 Modes**
    
    - **WPA2-PSK (Pre-Shared Key)** → Used for home networks.
        
    - **WPA2-Enterprise** → Used in corporate environments with authentication servers (e.g., RADIUS).
        

#### WPA2 Authentication Process (PSK Mode)

1️⃣ **User connects to Wi-Fi** and enters the **Wi-Fi password** (Pre-Shared Key).  
2️⃣ **The router and client use a handshake** to verify the password and generate an encryption key.  
3️⃣ **AES encryption secures the communication** to prevent eavesdropping.


### WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) 

**WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)** is the latest **Wi-Fi security protocol**, introduced in **2018** by the **Wi-Fi Alliance** to replace **WPA2**. It enhances **encryption, authentication, and protection** against attacks like **brute-force attacks** and **KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack)**.

🛡️ **WPA3 improves the security of both personal and enterprise networks with stronger encryption methods and enhanced authentication mechanisms.**
####  How WPA3 Works – Step-by-Step

WPA3 introduces **two main authentication modes:**
- **WPA3-Personal (for home users)**
- **WPA3-Enterprise (for businesses & government organizations)**
Each mode has **enhanced encryption and authentication mechanisms.**


### **🔹 WPA3-Personal: Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**

- Replaces **Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication** used in WPA2.
    
- Uses **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**, based on **Dragonfly Key Exchange**.
    
- Prevents **brute-force attacks** and ensures **forward secrecy**.
    

🔹 **🔑 WPA3-Personal Authentication Process (SAE)** 1️⃣ **Client (e.g., smartphone, laptop) sends a connection request to the Wi-Fi router.**  
2️⃣ **Router responds with a cryptographic challenge.**  
3️⃣ **Client and router perform a secure key exchange using SAE.**  
4️⃣ **A unique encryption key is generated for that session.**  
5️⃣ **Secure communication begins using AES-GCMP encryption.**

✅ **Why is this better?**

- Unlike WPA2, **the Wi-Fi password is never transmitted directly**.
    
- Prevents **offline dictionary attacks** (attackers can't guess passwords offline).
    
- **Even if an attacker captures a handshake, they can’t decrypt past sessions** (forward secrecy).
    

---

### **🔹 WPA3-Enterprise: Uses 192-bit Encryption Suite**

- Designed for **corporate, government, and military networks**.
    
- Uses **192-bit encryption** instead of 128-bit.
    
- Uses **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for stronger authentication.
    

🔹 **🔐 WPA3-Enterprise Authentication Process** 1️⃣ **Client connects to an enterprise Wi-Fi network.**  
2️⃣ **Authentication is performed using a RADIUS server (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS).**  
3️⃣ **Encryption is established using a 192-bit cryptographic suite.**  
4️⃣ **Secure communication is maintained with stronger cryptographic algorithms.**

✅ **Why is this better?**

- Uses **higher encryption standards** for sensitive data protection.
    
- **Mandatory certificate-based authentication** (reduces MITM attacks).
    
- **Resistant to quantum computing attacks**.


### What is SAE
Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is a **secure key exchange protocol** used in **WPA3-Personal** to replace **Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication** in WPA2. SAE is based on the **Dragonfly Key Exchange**, which provides resistance against **brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and key reinstallation attacks (KRACK).**

### **1. Why is SAE Needed?**

WPA2-PSK authentication has a major security weakness:

- When a device connects to a Wi-Fi network, it **sends a handshake that can be captured by an attacker.**
    
- If the attacker captures this handshake, they can use **offline brute-force attacks** to guess the password without needing to interact with the router.
    
- WPA2 does not provide **forward secrecy**, meaning if the password is compromised, **past and future communications can be decrypted.**
    

To eliminate these vulnerabilities, **SAE replaces PSK authentication with a more secure key exchange mechanism.**

---

### **2. How SAE Works – Step-by-Step Process**

SAE works by establishing a **mutual authentication process between two devices** before they establish a secure connection. Instead of transmitting the password, **both parties independently compute the same cryptographic key** using a process that prevents attackers from extracting the password.

#### **Step 1: Initial Connection Attempt**

- When a client (e.g., a smartphone) tries to connect to a WPA3-protected router, both devices initiate the SAE handshake.
    
- The router and client **already know the password** (but do not transmit it directly).
    

#### **Step 2: Password Element (PE) Computation**

- Both the client and the router use the shared **Wi-Fi password** to derive a **password element (PE)** using a **hash function**.
    
- The password element is used as an input for the key exchange, ensuring that the password itself is never transmitted.
    

#### **Step 3: Commitment Exchange**

- The router generates a **random number (nonce)** and combines it with the **password element** to create a cryptographic commitment.
    
- The router sends this commitment to the client.
    
- The client does the same and sends its own commitment to the router.
    
- This step ensures both parties are engaged in the authentication process before proceeding further.
    

#### **Step 4: Challenge Exchange**

- After receiving each other’s commitment, the router and client send **another value (proof of commitment)** to confirm their knowledge of the password element.
    
- This ensures that neither party can fake authentication.
    

#### **Step 5: Key Derivation and Session Key Generation**

- If the challenge exchange is successful, both parties **compute the same cryptographic key** from the exchanged data.
    
- The final session key is derived using a **hashing function (e.g., HMAC-SHA256)**.
    
- This key is **unique for each session**, preventing replay attacks.
    

#### **Step 6: Encrypted Communication Begins**

- Once both the client and the router derive the same key, they establish an **encrypted session** for secure communication.
    
- Because **each session generates a new encryption key**, even if an attacker compromises one session, they cannot decrypt past or future communications.

### **3. Security Advantages of SAE over WPA2-PSK**

1. **Eliminates Offline Dictionary Attacks**
    
    - WPA2-PSK allowed attackers to capture handshakes and try password guesses offline.
        
    - With SAE, password verification happens in **real-time** and requires **interaction with the router**, preventing offline attacks.
        
2. **Provides Forward Secrecy**
    
    - Each connection session generates a unique encryption key.
        
    - Even if an attacker later discovers the password, they **cannot decrypt previously captured data.**
        
3. **Prevents Key Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK)**
    
    - WPA2-PSK was vulnerable to **KRACK attacks**, where attackers could manipulate key exchanges to reuse old keys.
        
    - SAE ensures that each authentication **creates a fresh session key**, making key reuse attacks impossible.
        
4. **Does Not Transmit the Password**
    
    - WPA2 sends hash-derived password verification over the network, which attackers can exploit.
        
    - SAE **never transmits the password or its hash**, reducing the risk of password leakage.


### Autonomous Access Point
<p align="justify">An **Autonomous Access Point (AP)**, also known as a **Standalone AP**, is a type of wireless access point that operates independently without requiring a centralized wireless controller. It has **built-in intelligence** to handle all necessary Wi-Fi functions, such as authentication, encryption, and traffic management, making it a self-sufficient network device.</p>
#### Key Characteristics of an Autonomous AP

    - Each AP is individually configured and managed.
        
    - Does not rely on a wireless controller for operation.
        
2. **On-Device Authentication & Encryption**
    
    - Handles security functions like **WPA2, WPA3, and MAC filtering** on its own.
        
3. **Independent Traffic Handling**
    
    - Manages wireless clients and routes traffic without external dependency.
        
4. **Ideal for Small Deployments**
    
    - Suitable for **home networks, small offices, and retail stores** where only a few APs are needed.


### Controller-Based-Access point
A **Controller-Based Access Point (AP)** is a type of wireless access point that **does not function independently** but is instead centrally managed by a **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**. This allows for **centralized configuration, security, monitoring, and management** of multiple APs in a network.

### **Key Characteristics of Controller-Based APs**

1. **Centralized Management**
    
    - APs are **configured and controlled** by a central **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**.
        
    - No need to configure each AP individually.
        
2. **Seamless Roaming**
    
    - Enables **fast roaming** between APs without connection drops.
        
    - Ideal for large networks like enterprises, hospitals, and universities.
        
3. **Uniform Security Policies**
    
    - Security settings (**WPA3, MAC filtering, VLAN segmentation**) are applied across all APs.
        
4. **Scalability**
    
    - Can handle **hundreds to thousands of APs** with a single controller.
        
5. **Optimized Network Performance**
    
    - **Load balancing, interference reduction, and traffic management** are handled dynamically.

### **Differences Between Controller-Based AP and Autonomous AP**

| Feature                      | **Controller-Based AP**                                                       | **Autonomous AP**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
