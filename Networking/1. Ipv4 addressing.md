ipv4 is divided into 4 octets . each octect consists of 8 bits which makes 32 bits in total.8 bits=1 bytes

```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
```

- one octet is `2**8` which sums up to 256 possibilities
- four octects is `2**32` which sums to 4,294,967,296 possibilities

- ipv4 range from
```
0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255
```
 An ipv4 address consists of 2 parts
 1. Network part
 2. Host part

### Ipv4 Address Classes:
IPv4 addresses are divided into **five classes (A, B, C, D, and E)** based on their first octet:

|Class|First Octet Range|Default Subnet Mask|Network Bits|Host Bits|Max Networks|Max Hosts per Network|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|1 - 126|255.0.0.0|8|24|128|16,777,214|
|B|128 - 191|255.255.0.0|16|16|16,384|65,534|
|C|192 - 223|255.255.255.0|24|8|2,097,152|254|
|D|224 - 239|N/A (Multicast)|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|
|E|240 - 255|N/A (Experimental)|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|

- **Class A**: Large networks (e.g., ISPs, large organizations).
- **Class B**: Medium-sized networks.
- **Class C**: Small networks (e.g., home, small businesses).
- **Class D**: Used for **multicasting**.
- **Class E**: Reserved for experimental use.

## Private Ip Addresses
some range of ips are assigned for private use which will be not used on internet. these addresses are used behind the routers

- **Class A**: `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
- **Class B**: `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
- **Class C**: `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`

### Types of IPv4 Addresses:
#### Unicast Address:
**Definition**: A unicast address is used for one-to-one communication between a source and a single destination.
#### Broadcast Address
**Definition**: A broadcast address is used for one-to-all communication, sending data to **all hosts** in a network.

#### Multicast Address
**Definition**: A multicast address is used for one-to-many communication, sending data to **multiple devices** in a specific group.


### Subnetting:
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller sub-networks for better efficiency.
#### Network & Host Portions of an IP:

Every IP address consists of:

- **Network Portion:** Identifies the network.
- **Host Portion:** Identifies specific devices within the network.

For example, in **192.168.1.0/24**:

- `192.168.1.0` (Network Address)
- `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` (Usable Host Addresses)
- `192.168.1.255` (Broadcast Address)

#### Attributes of Subnetting:
1. Network ID
2. Broadcast ip
3. First Host ip
4. Last Host ip
5. Next Network Address
6. No: of IP Addresses in the network
7. CIDR notation

#### Subnet Mask
The Subnet mask tells us which part of the ip address belongs to network and which part belongs to the host
```
255.255.255.0 == 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

#### Subnet Increment:
Subnet increment is the step or interval at which the subnets are divided within an ip range. It tells u the starting point of each subnet within a given octet based on subnet mask
```
SI= 256- last octet of the subnet mask
```

#### No: of Hosts in a Network
```
2^h -2  his the number of borrowed bits from the host portion
		2 is for network and broadcast address
```

#### No: of IP addresses in a Network
In case of class c ips its same of SI
but in case of class b its 
```
2^(32-CIDR)
```


`Example` : Find the network and broadcast address of 192.168.1.130/26

Calculating the subnet mask
CIDR /26 means the first 26 buts are used for network part and other  for remaining part. Based on this writing the binary form of subnet mask
```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
```

converting the binary subnet mask into decimal will give us the subnet mask
```
255.255.255.192
```

Calculating the Subnet Increment:
```
SI= 256-192(last octet of subnet mask)
SI=64
```
SI=64 which means each network is divided into 64 equal parts and each network has 64 ip addresses

Network blocks
```
192.168.1.0 
	|
192.168.1.64
	|
192.168.1.128
	|
192.168.1.192
```
The ip given in the question is 192.168.1.130 which lies in between 192.168.1.128 -- 192.168.1.192

1. Network ID == 192.168.1.128
2. Broadcast ip == 192.168.191
3. First Host ip == 192.168.1.129
4. Last Host ip == 192.168.1. 190
5. Next Network Address == 192.168.1.192
6. No: of IP Addresses in the network = same as SI == 64
7. CIDR notation= /26

#### Splitting the Network

We are given **192.168.1.0/24** and need to divide it into **4 equal subnets**.

Step 1: Determine the New Prefix

1. A **/24** subnet has **256 IPs** (`2^8`).
    
2. To divide it into **4 equal subnets**, we need to find the number of **extra bits** required for subnetting.
    
3. The formula for subnet division is:
    
    2n=Number of Subnets2^n = \text{Number of Subnets}
    - We need **4 subnets**, so:
        
        2^n=4
        2^n = 4 
        n=2
    - Since the original subnet mask was **/24**, adding 2 extra bits gives us:
        
        /24+2=/26/24 + 2 = /26
    - **New subnet prefix = /26**
        
    - This means the subnet mask changes from `255.255.255.0` (for /24) to `255.255.255.192` (for /26).
        

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Subnet Ranges**

Now, we find the **Subnet Increment** to determine the ranges of each subnet.

Increment=256−Last Octet of Subnet Mask\text{Increment} = 256 - \text{Last Octet of Subnet Mask} =256−192=64= 256 - 192 = 64

This means each **subnet starts at multiples of 64** in the last octet.

---

### **Step 3: Identify the Subnet Ranges**

Each subnet contains **64 IPs** (`0 - 63`, `64 - 127`, etc.), and we calculate the network and broadcast addresses.

|**Subnet**|**Network Address**|**Usable IP Range**|**Broadcast Address**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Subnet 1**|`192.168.1.0/26`|`192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62`|`192.168.1.63`|
|**Subnet 2**|`192.168.1.64/26`|`192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.126`|`192.168.1.127`|
|**Subnet 3**|`192.168.1.128/26`|`192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190`|`192.168.1.191`|
|**Subnet 4**|`192.168.1.192/26`|`192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.254`|`192.168.1.255`|

---

### **Final Answer:**

The **4 equal subnets** of `192.168.1.0/24` (split into `/26` networks) are:

1. **`192.168.1.0/26` → `192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63`**
2. **`192.168.1.64/26` → `192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127`**
3. **`192.168.1.128/26` → `192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191`**
4. **`192.168.1.192/26` → `192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255`**

Each subnet has:

- **64 total IPs**
- **62 usable IPs** (since the first is the network address and the last is the broadcast address)

#### Fixed Length Subnet Mask
It is a networking methodology that divides the block of Ip addresses into multiple subnets of equal lengths or equal no of addresses. All subnets have same subnet mask and same no of hosts

### (A) Understanding FLSM Subnetting

- A network is divided into **equal-sized subnets**.
- The subnet mask is **fixed** for all subnets.
- IPs are often **wasted** if a subnet doesn’t need all assigned IPs.

#### **Example 1: Subnetting 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 FLSM Subnets**

1. **192.168.1.0/24 has 256 IPs (usable: 254).**
    
2. **4 subnets needed** → Find a subnet mask that creates at least 4 subnets.
    
3. **Formula:**
    
    Subnet Calculation=2^h≥Number of Subnets
    
    
    Where **h** is the number of borrowed bits from the host portion.
    
4. **2² = 4** → Borrow **2 bits** → **New subnet mask = /26 (255.255.255.192)**
    

|**Subnet**|**Network Address**|**Usable IPs**|**Broadcast Address**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st|192.168.1.0/26|192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62|192.168.1.63|
|2nd|192.168.1.64/26|192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.126|192.168.1.127|
|3rd|192.168.1.128/26|192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190|192.168.1.191|
|4th|192.168.1.192/26|192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.254|192.168.1.255|

🚀 **Result:** All subnets have **64 total IPs (62 usable)**, even if not all are needed.

---

### **(B) FLSM Subnetting in Class A, B, and C**

#### **Class C Example (192.168.0.0/24)**

- Subnet into **8 equal subnets**
- Formula: **2³ = 8** → Borrow **3 bits** → New **mask = /27 (255.255.255.224)**

|**Subnet**|**Network Address**|**Usable IPs**|
|---|---|---|
|1st|192.168.0.0/27|192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.30|
|2nd|192.168.0.32/27|192.168.0.33 - 192.168.0.62|
|3rd|192.168.0.64/27|192.168.0.65 - 192.168.0.94|
|4th|192.168.0.96/27|192.168.0.97 - 192.168.0.126|

---

### **4. Advanced FLSM Example**

#### **Scenario: A Company Has 6 Departments Needing Equal IPs**

**Given:**

- Company has **172.16.0.0/16**.
- Each department needs **subnets with 200 hosts**.
- FLSM means **all subnets must be the same size**.

1. **Find the smallest subnet mask for 200 hosts**:
    
    - Formula: **2^h - 2 ≥ 200**
    - **h = 8** (2⁸ = 256, usable = 254) → **Subnet mask = /24** (255.255.255.0).
2. **Allocate Subnets:**
    

|**Department**|**Network Address**|**Usable Hosts**|
|---|---|---|
|HR|172.16.0.0/24|172.16.0.1 - 172.16.0.254|
|IT|172.16.1.0/24|172.16.1.1 - 172.16.1.254|
|Sales|172.16.2.0/24|172.16.2.1 - 172.16.2.254|
|Support|172.16.3.0/24|172.16.3.1 - 172.16.3.254|

**Problem:**

- Each department **only needs 200 hosts**, but **254 are assigned** → **IP wastage**.
- **Better Alternative?** **VLSM**, which assigns **only the required IPs** per subnet.

#### Variable Length Subnet mask
**VLSM (Variable-Length Subnet Masking)** allows the use of **different subnet masks within the same network**, making IP allocation **more efficient** compared to Fixed-Length Subnet Masking (**FLSM**).

####  How Does VLSM Work?

##### **Step 1: Identify Subnet Requirements**

Each subnet requires a **different number of hosts**, so we assign the smallest subnet mask that fits the requirement.

##### **Example Scenario:**

A company has been assigned **192.168.1.0/24** and needs subnets for:

1. **50 hosts**
2. **25 hosts**
3. **10 hosts**
4. **5 hosts**

---

##### **Step 2: Find the Best Subnet Mask for Each Subnet

Use the **Usable Hosts Formula** to determine the required subnet size:

Usable Hosts=2h−2\text{Usable Hosts} = 2^h - 2

Where **h** = number of host bits.

|**Subnet**|**Required Hosts**|**Usable Hosts**|**Subnet Mask**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Subnet 1|50|**62** (2⁶ - 2)|**/26** (255.255.255.192)|
|Subnet 2|25|**30** (2⁵ - 2)|**/27** (255.255.255.224)|
|Subnet 3|10|**14** (2⁴ - 2)|**/28** (255.255.255.240)|
|Subnet 4|5|**6** (2³ - 2)|**/29** (255.255.255.248)|

---

##### **Step 3: Assign Subnet Ranges**

Allocate IPs **from largest to smallest** to avoid fragmentation.

| **Subnet**          | **Network Address**  | **Usable IPs**                | **Broadcast Address** | **Subnet Mask** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Subnet 1 (50 hosts) | **192.168.1.0/26**   | 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62    | 192.168.1.63          | 255.255.255.192 |
| Subnet 2 (25 hosts) | **192.168.1.64/27**  | 192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.94   | 192.168.1.95          | 255.255.255.224 |
| Subnet 3 (10 hosts) | **192.168.1.96/28**  | 192.168.1.97 - 192.168.1.110  | 192.168.1.111         | 255.255.255.240 |
| Subnet 4 (5 hosts)  | **192.168.1.112/29** | 192.168.1.113 - 192.168.1.118 | 192.168.1.119         | 255.255.255.248 |

📌 **Remaining IPs** start at **192.168.1.120**, which can be used for future expansion.

#### 4. Advanced VLSM Example

**Scenario:**  
A company is assigned **172.16.0.0/16** and needs:

- **1 subnet with 1000 hosts**
- **1 subnet with 500 hosts**
- **1 subnet with 200 hosts**
- **1 subnet with 50 hosts**

---

### **Step 1: Determine Required Subnet Mask for Each**

| **Subnet** | **Required Hosts** | **Usable Hosts**   | **Subnet Mask**           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Subnet 1   | 1000               | **1022** (2¹⁰ - 2) | **/22** (255.255.252.0)   |
| Subnet 2   | 500                | **510** (2⁹ - 2)   | **/23** (255.255.254.0)   |
| Subnet 3   | 200                | **254** (2⁸ - 2)   | **/24** (255.255.255.0)   |
| Subnet 4   | 50                 | **62** (2⁶ - 2)    | **/26** (255.255.255.192) |

---

### **Step 2: Assign Subnet Ranges**

📌 **Start with the largest subnet to prevent fragmentation.**

|**Subnet**|**Network Address**|**Usable IPs**|**Broadcast Address**|**Subnet Mask**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Subnet 1 (1000 hosts)|**172.16.0.0/22**|172.16.0.1 - 172.16.3.254|172.16.3.255|255.255.252.0|
|Subnet 2 (500 hosts)|**172.16.4.0/23**|172.16.4.1 - 172.16.5.254|172.16.5.255|255.255.254.0|
|Subnet 3 (200 hosts)|**172.16.6.0/24**|172.16.6.1 - 172.16.6.254|172.16.6.255|255.255.255.0|
|Subnet 4 (50 hosts)|**172.16.7.0/26**|172.16.7.1 - 172.16.7.62|172.16.7.63|255.255.255.192|
