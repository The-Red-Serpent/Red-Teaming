### AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

AAA consists of three key functions:

1. **Authentication** – Verifies a user's identity before granting access.
    
    - Example: Entering a username and password to log in to a router.
        
2. **Authorization** – Determines what actions the user can perform after authentication.
    
    - Example: A regular user may have read-only access, while an admin can configure the router.
        
3. **Accounting** – Tracks user activities for auditing and monitoring.
    
    - Example: Keeping a log of all commands entered by an admin.


#### AAA Implementation in Cisco Devices
Cisco devices can use **AAA in two ways**:

1. **Local AAA** – Uses the device’s own database for authentication.
    
2. **Server-Based AAA** – Uses an external server like RADIUS or TACACS+ for authentication.
```
Router(config)# aaa new-model
```


- **AAA Authentication (Verifying User Identity)**
    
    - Local Authentication (Using Router’s Local Database)
        
    - Server-Based Authentication (Using RADIUS Server)
        
    - Applying Authentication to Console or SSH Access
        
- **AAA Authorization (Controlling User Privileges)**
    
    - Local Authorization
        
    - Server-Based Authorization (Using RADIUS Server)
        
- **AAA Accounting (Tracking User Activities)**
    
    - Enabling Accounting for Login Sessions
        
    - Enabling Accounting for Commands Executed

### **RADIUS and TACACS+ (AAA Protocols)**

#### **1. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**

- A network protocol used for **user authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)**.
    
- Developed by **IETF** and commonly used for **network access control** (Wi-Fi, VPN, 802.1X authentication).
    
- Uses **UDP (Ports 1812 for authentication, 1813 for accounting)**.
    
- Encrypts only the **password**, leaving other packet details visible.
    
- Combines **authentication and authorization** in a single process.
    

#### **2. TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)**

- A Cisco-developed AAA protocol for **device management authentication** (routers, switches, firewalls).
    
- Uses **TCP (Port 49)**, ensuring more reliable communication.
    
- Encrypts the **entire communication**, making it more secure than RADIUS.
    
- Separates **authentication, authorization, and accounting**, allowing more granular control.
    

- Configure RADUIS and TACACS+

### Port Security

**Port Security** is a feature on Cisco **switches** that helps **restrict access to a switch port** by limiting the number of devices that can connect. It prevents **unauthorized devices** from accessing the network and helps **mitigate MAC address spoofing attacks**.
### **How Port Security Works**

- Each switch port can **learn and store MAC addresses**.
    
- You can **limit the number of MAC addresses** per port.
    
- If an unauthorized device tries to connect, the switch can **take action** based on the configured violation mode.

### **Port Security Violation Modes**

| **Mode**     | **Action Taken**                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Protect**  | Drops unauthorized traffic but does not log or disable the port.   |
| **Restrict** | Drops unauthorized traffic and logs a security violation.          |
| **Shutdown** | Disables the port (default mode) and requires manual reactivation. |
### **MAC Limit and Sticky MACs in Port Security**

#### **1. MAC Limit (Maximum MAC Addresses per Port)**

- **Limits the number of MAC addresses** that can be learned on a switch port.
    
- If the limit is exceeded, the port follows the **configured violation mode** (Protect, Restrict, Shutdown).
    
- Example: Allow only **2 devices** to connect on a port.
    

#### **2. Sticky MAC Addresses**

- **Dynamically learns and stores MAC addresses** in the switch's running configuration.
    
- Converts **dynamically learned** MAC addresses into **static MAC entries**.
    
- Ensures that **only specific devices** can connect to the port after being learned.
    
- MAC addresses are stored **permanently** after saving the configuration.
